Some simple programming exercises that have already been done multiple
times. These are my implementations.

The code in this repository may be educational, but the point of these
exercises is doing them yourself, not copying the answers off the
internet. Why am I publishing this? Well, there are some people who
need to see non-propietary code I have written. This is some of it.
